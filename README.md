Blythe Mountain Light
===========

The Blythe Mountain Light Project is the realization of a Rick Swanner's dream to put a light at the top of the highest peak in Blythe, CA. 

## Project Requirements
### 1. Light installation to function in an exposed outdoor desert environment. 
Temperatures in range of 120+ Â°F and below freezing, intermittant seasonal rainfall, dust storms, and direct UV exposure to be accounted for. Installation location difficult to reach, making regular adjustments or maintenance unsustainable.

### 2. Installation's power to be completely self sustainable. 
There is no local power located at the installation location. Power will need to be fully generated and/or contained by the unit independent of outside sources. 

### 3. Light will need to be visible from Blythe city center, Rick Swanner's front door.
The light installation's greatest measure of success will be whether or not the light is visible from Blythe. 

### 4. Stay to budget under $100
All expenses related to purchases of components, sensors, panels, and hardware to remain under $100.00
